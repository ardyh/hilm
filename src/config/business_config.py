One promising avenue is selling ready-to-drink tea to restaurants, where tea is often served as a staple beverage. Our goal is to assess the market size and potential for this B2B expansion, considering competition from other tea providers and the unique positioning of our ready-to-drink products compared to traditional brewed tea. This analysis will help us evaluate how much market share we can realistically capture while maintaining profitability and differentiating our offerings.",
